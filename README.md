# pyExportTrelloList

## What it does
This python script exports a Trello list from a PRIVATE Trello board list through the API. And it gets saved to your clipboard, ready to paste into an e-mail! Just enter your list name, et voila! 
You should install pyperclip (pip install pyperclip) to have the changelog automatically pasted in your clipboard.

## How to use it
Just edit the TrelloKeys.json with your own Trello Key, Token and board ID, and you're good to go.
