# pyExportTrelloList

## What it does
This python script exports a Trello list from a PRIVATE Trello board list through the API. And it gets saved to your clipboard, ready to paste into an e-mail! Just enter your list name, et voila! 
You should install pyperclip (pip install pyperclip) to have the changelog automatically pasted in your clipboard.

## How to use it
Just edit the TrelloKeys.json with your own Trello Key, Token and board ID, and you're good to go.
Trello Key: https://trello.com/app-key
Trello Token: Click the Token link in the previously linked web page
Trello Board id: Go to your Trello board you want to export & add .json to the end of your URL. Your board id is the first thing in the list.
